This project aims to provide the necessary code for the
management of link lists including the storing and reading from
file/to a file named ListFile.txt
It gives you the oportunity to chose the way the list is ordered 
(ascending, descending, as it comes), whether you are at the stage
of buiding up from keyboard or from a file. Every node of the list
contains a number and the address of the next node. The input for the list
can be only integer numbers.
The basic files to check are main.cpp, List.cpp and List.h. The ListFile.txt
that has the data of the list must not have empty lines past its last data.

Developed in VS not only by me but by her also.
